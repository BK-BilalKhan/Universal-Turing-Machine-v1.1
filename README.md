# Universal Turing Machine v1.1
Universal Turing Machine (UTM) - Version 1.1

# Introduction
In computer science, a universal Turing machine (UTM) is a Turing machine that can simulate an arbitrary Turing machine on arbitrary input. The universal machine essentially achieves this by reading both the description of the machine to be simulated as well as the input thereof from its own tape.
